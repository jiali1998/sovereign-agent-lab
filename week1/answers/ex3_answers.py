Exercise 3 — Answers
====================
Fill this in after completing the three Rasa conversations.

CALM vs Old Rasa — what changed
---------------------------------
The old open-source Rasa approach used:
  - nlu.yml: intent training examples
  - rules.yml: explicit dialogue rules
  - FormValidationAction: Python class to parse slot values

Rasa Pro CALM uses:
  - flows.yml: natural language descriptions of what each flow does
  - from_llm slots: the LLM extracts values from conversation
  - ONE custom action: ActionValidateBooking for the business rules

The conversation is the same from the manager's perspective.
The machinery underneath is completely different.

CONVERSATION SCRIPTS
---------------------
Conversation 1 (happy path):
  You:    calling to confirm a booking
  Agent:  [asks guest count]
  You:    160 guests
  Agent:  [asks vegan count]
  You:    about 50 need vegan
  Agent:  [asks deposit]
  You:    £200 deposit
  Agent:  [confirms or escalates?]

Conversation 2 (deposit too high):
  Same as above but use a deposit above £300 (e.g. "£500 deposit").

Conversation 3 (out of scope):
  Start normally, then when asked for vegan count say something like
  "can you arrange parking for the speakers?" and observe what happens.
  Does CALM handle this differently than the old rules approach?

# Describe what CALM did after the out-of-scope message. Min 20 words.
CONVERSATION_3_WHAT_HAPPENED = """
After the out-of-scope message, CALM refused the request cleanly — said it can't help with parking.
It the stayed in the flow — it didn't abandon the booking confirmation.
It lastly offered to continue — asked "Would you like to continue with confirm booking?"
"""

# Compare Rasa CALM's handling of the out-of-scope request to what
# LangGraph did in Exercise 2 Scenario 3. Min 40 words.
OUT_OF_SCOPE_COMPARISON = """
This is the key difference from the LangGraph agent. CALM didn't try to improvise an answer or call a tool — it deflected and then held its position in the flow, waiting to resume exactly where it left off (still needing the vegan meal count). The conversation state was preserved across the interruption.

Temporarily changed the condition to `if True:` to force the cutoff guard to
always trigger, then ran a booking conversation and verified the agent responded
with the escalation message about insufficient time before the 5 PM deadline.
Reverted the condition back to the time-based check and retrained.
"""

# ── CALM vs Old Rasa ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# In the old open-source Rasa (3.6.x), you needed:
#   ValidateBookingConfirmationForm with regex to parse "about 160" → 160.0
#   nlu.yml intent examples to classify "I'm calling to confirm"
#   rules.yml to define every dialogue path
#
# In Rasa Pro CALM, you need:
#   flow descriptions so the LLM knows when to trigger confirm_booking
#   from_llm slot mappings so the LLM extracts values from natural speech
#   ONE action class (ActionValidateBooking) for the business rules
#
# What does this simplification cost? What does it gain?
# Min 30 words.

CALM_VS_OLD_RASA = """
CALM gains: the LLM now handles all language understanding via from_llm slot
mappings — "about 160 people", "one-sixty", and "we're expecting 160" all
resolve to 160.0 without any Python regex or NLU training examples.
This eliminates ValidateBookingConfirmationForm entirely.

Python still enforces the business rules (deposit cap, capacity ceiling, vegan
ratio, time cutoff) because these are deterministic financial and legal constraints
that must not bend to natural language reasoning or edge-case LLM logic.

The old approach was more auditable at the NLU layer — we could inspect every
intent example and regex. CALM trades that transparency for much less code.
"""

# ── The setup cost ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# CALM still required: config.yml, domain.yml, flows.yml, endpoints.yml,
# rasa train, two terminals, and a Rasa Pro licence.
# The old Rasa ALSO needed nlu.yml, rules.yml, and a FormValidationAction.
#
# CALM is simpler. But it's still significantly more setup than LangGraph.
# That setup bought you something specific.
# Min 40 words.

SETUP_COST_VALUE = """
The setup cost bought determinism and auditability for high-stakes decisions.
The CALM agent cannot improvise a response it wasn't trained on — it will deflect
out-of-scope questions rather than reason freely. It cannot call a tool that
wasn't defined in flows.yml. For the confirmation use case, this is a feature,
not a limitation: we need a guarantee that the agent will never commit to terms
beyond what was authorised, never hallucinate a deposit figure, and never go
off-script mid-negotiation. LangGraph could improvise and solve novel problems;
CALM cannot — and in a legally binding phone call, that inability is exactly
what we want.
